# This file is DEPRECATED, not used anymore and marked for DELETION.
# This file hold data for CRHF values for various genes. 
# It is possible to model CRHF values along various parameters, but these features have not been implemented yet (due to lack of time and data). 
# The "constant" model assumes a constant frequenca in the general population independent of population, age and gender. 
# Special cases (like CRHF values for the Ashkenazi Jewish population) can be stated analogous to the "constant" model.
